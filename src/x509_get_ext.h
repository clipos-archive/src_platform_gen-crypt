/**
 * Those functions are imported from OpenSSL development sources as they are
 * not available in the currently used version (OpenSSL 1.0.2e). Imported from
 * OpenSSL repository, commit: 063f1f0c693a10aab6a7227df15d4120ed824856.
 *
 * Those functions are intentionally conflicting with the ones from a future
 * version of OpenSSL as they should be removed as soon as OpenSSL supports
 * them directly.
 *
 * In OpenSSL 1.0.2e, cert->ex_flags is unsigned long.
 * In OpenSSL master branch, cert->ex_flags is uint32_t.
 *
 * Thus the following temporary change has been made to the OpenSSL API:
 * X509_get_extension_flags and X509_get_key_usage will return UINT32_MAX if
 * the value of cert->ex_flags exceeds UINT32_MAX.
 *
 * As the x509 typedef struct will become private in a future version of
 * OpenSSL, no manual manipulation of the X509 structure should take place in
 * any function not explicitly included here.
 *
 * Warning: Those functions call a modified version of x509v3_cache_extensions
 * that only sets the following flags: EXFLAG_V1, EXFLAG_CA, EXFLAG_SET,
 * EXFLAG_INVALID, EXFLAG_BCONS, EXFLAG_KUSAGE.
 *
 * Locking has been intentionally removed as the gencrypt API is not thread
 * safe anyway.
