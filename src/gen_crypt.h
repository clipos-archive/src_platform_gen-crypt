 *
 * This file defines the cryptographic API used by the software components to
 * sign and verify signature for package updates. This API is meant to be
 * implemented using any underlying implementation of the cryptography, e.g. a
 * library relying on OpenSSL (libcrypto), or using a PKCS#11-compliant token.
 * For the time being, no PKCS#11-compliant library has actually been
 * developed, and PKCS#11-related comments are only what the API design allows
 * to anticipate.
 *
 * @note Operations dealing with certificate checking are not part of the
 * PKCS#11 standard: one has to use another library to carry out these
 * operations.
 *
 * Functions with the return type @e gen_crypt_ret will return @c C_OK on
 * success and @c C_NOK on failure.
 *
 * @section section_opaque Opaque data types in this API
 *
 * @subsection subsection_context Cryptographic contexts
 *
 * There is classically a difference between cryptographic operations dealing
 * with public elements (e.g. certificates and public keys) and those involving
 * secret keys. Certificate operations are not specified in the PKCS#11
 * standard: one has to use another library to carry out these operations.
 * Even in OpenSSL, context information dealt with are of different types
 * compared to non-PKI related operations. We therefore choose to define two
 * different context types (opaque data types):
 *   @li @c gen_crypt_ctx for operations involving private keys,
 *   @li @c gen_crypt_chk_ctx for verification related operations.
 *
 * Specific initialization and finalization routines are implemented for each
 * specific context type, and they do not replace global initialization and
 * finalization functions.
 *
 * Each version (civil) of the library has its own implementation of the
 * checking context. It should be noted that contexts should not be manipulated
 * directly by functions of the gen-crypt library, but only through getters and
 * setters defined on purpose in civil-chk_ctx.h. These files also hold the
 * definition of constant @c MAX_CHK_CTX, which sets at compile time the
 * maximum number of contexts that can be used simultaneously in an instance of
 * the library. Moreover, these files export an interface to cache a user
 * certificate (see gen_crypt_verify_with_cache()).
 *
 * The following functions do not depend on any context:
 *   @li gen_crypt_init() / gen_crypt_end(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_get_certificate(),
 *   @li default_hash(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_ca_info() / gen_crypt_free_ca_info(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_priv_info() / gen_crypt_free_priv_info().
 *
 * The following functions depend on a gen_crypt_ctx context:
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_sign(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_sign(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_end_sign().
 *
 * The following functions depend on a gen_crypt_chk_ctx context:
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_check(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_end_check(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_verify(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_verify_with_cache().
 *
 * @subsection subsection_priv Information Opaque type related functions
 *
 * Two opaque data types are defined:
 *   @li @c gen_crypt_ca_info: information required for signature verification,
 *   @li @c gen_crypt_priv_info: information required for signature creation.
 *
 * Each underlying library used to implement the gen-crypt API may require
 * different informations for signature creation and validation. As the
 * gen-crypt API must remain generic, the implementation of these types and
 * related functions is private to each underlying library. Programs using the
 * gen-crypt API should not depend on internal properties of those types.
 *
 * The functions available to manipulate those types are:
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_ca_info() / gen_crypt_free_ca_info(),
 *   @li gen_crypt_init_priv_info() / gen_crypt_free_priv_info().
 *
